# Computational Methods
This repository contains essential python functions for numerical techniques such as root finding, solving ODEs and optimization that are most commonly used by undergraduate students in CHBE. The material was originally developed for teaching CHBE 230 (Computational Methods) by **Arman Seyed-Ahmadi**. Additional examples and notebooks have been added by **Danie Benetton**. The content is now organized in a way that the functions can be used in numerical operations in other courses as well.
